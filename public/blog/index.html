<h2>GCC 4</h2>

<p>Thanks to Greg, Cyclone now works with GCC 4.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to use the latest Cyclone from SVN;
instructions are at <a href='/wiki/Download'>Download</a>.</p>

<p>Attention: Cyclone (latest SVN) runs out of the box on <a href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix</a>!</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<h2>Cross-compiling for the Nokia 770</h2>

<p>The Nokia 770 has limited processing power: a 220MHz ARM-based CPU,
64MB RAM, and 128MB of non-volative storage (flash).  Using the
Cyclone compiler on such a limited system would be painful, maybe
impossible.  Instead we&#8217;ll use a special Cyclone compiler on a more
powerful machine, and compile the programs there before transferring
them to the 770 to run.  The process is about the same regardless of
whether you want to compile for the 770, the Nintendo DS, the iPod, or
even more limited platforms.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this is getting a cross-compiling gcc.
Fortunately, Nokia is using standard open source tools for their
development environment, and binary distributions and good
documentation are easily available.</p>

<h3>Installing the cross-compiler</h3>

<p>The basic development environment is <a href="http://scratchbox.org/">Scratchbox</a>.  Scratchbox is a
set of cross-compilers and emulators that let you simulate working on
one processor architecture, while in fact running on a completely
different architecture.  In our case, we&#8217;ll be able to compile and
execute ARM code while running on an x86 machine.</p>

<p>You can install Scratchbox and Maemo (the Nokia-specific devkit) using
<a href="http://www.scratchbox.org/wiki/Sbox102Maemo">these instructions</a>.  Due to our particular needs, we&#8217;ll use a
different set of packages than those mentioned in those instructions.
Here&#8217;s the complete list of tarballs that I used:</p>

<pre><code>scratchbox-core-1.0.4-i386.tar.gz
scratchbox-libs-1.0.3-i386.tar.gz
scratchbox-toolchain-arm-gcc3.4-glibc2.3-1.0.2-i386.tar.gz
scratchbox-toolchain-host-gcc-1.0.5-i386.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>The tarballs are available <a href="http://www.scratchbox.org/download/files/sbox-releases/1.0/tarball/">here</a>.  I didn&#8217;t bother to install any
Scratchbox devkits, or the Maemo SDK, as these aren&#8217;t necessary to
cross compile simple command-line applications.</p>

<p>After following the instructions you should have a working Scratchbox
with ARM target.  This means that when you are logged in to the
Scratchbox in the ARM target, you are running ARM binaries via
emulation.  We also need a HOST target, where you can run
x86 binaries natively.  The setup for HOST is about the same as for ARM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using sb-menu, choose &#8220;Setup&#8221; to create the HOST target.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Name the target HOST</li>
  <li>Select host-gcc compiler</li>
  <li>Select debian and perl devkits</li>
  <li>Select &#8220;none&#8221; for CPU transparency method</li>
  <li>Select &#8220;no&#8221; for installing files</li>
  <li>Select &#8220;yes&#8221; for selecting the target</li>
  <li>Exit sb-menu.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You should now be running inside the HOST target in Scratchbox.</p>

<h3>Installing Cyclone</h3>

<p>Now, on to Cyclone.  <a href="/wiki/Download">Download the distribution; you&#8217;ll need to use
the SVN version to be sure it works with Maemo.</a>
Place the distribution in your Scratchbox home directory and cd to the
toplevel directory.  Configure and build:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --target=arm-maemo-elf
make
make install
</code></pre>

<p>Now, create the canonical first program:</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt; hello.cyc &lt;&lt;ZZZ
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main () { printf("Hello, world!\n"); return 0; }
ZZZ
</code></pre>

<p>Compile it with</p>

<pre><code>cyclone hello.cyc -nogc -b arm-maemo-elf
</code></pre>

<p>Transfer the resulting a.out to your 770.  On most Linux systems you
can simply plug in the 770 over USB and drag the file over; this will
put the program on the memory card.  <strong>Be sure to move the program off
of the memory card to your home directory</strong>, because it won&#8217;t run from
the memory card.</p>

<p>Finally, run it from an xterm:</p>

<p><img src="/files/770-hello.jpg" alt="Hello world on a 770" /></p>

<h3>Under the covers</h3>

<p>A couple of details.  When you did</p>

<pre><code>./configure --target=arm-maemo-elf
</code></pre>

<p>you set Cyclone up so that both a native (x86) compiler and a cross
(ARM) compiler would be built.  Because Cyclone uses gcc and
associated tools as its back end, the difference between the two is
just that the ARM version invokes a cross gcc toolchain instead of the
native toolchain.  If you examine the generated Makefile.inc, you&#8217;ll
see these lines:</p>

<pre><code>TARGET_CC=/scratchbox/compilers/arm-linux-gcc3.4.cs-glibc2.3/bin/arm-linux-gcc
TARGET_CFLAGS=
TARGET_RANLIB=/scratchbox/compilers/arm-linux-gcc3.4.cs-glibc2.3/bin/arm-linux-ranlib
TARGET_AR=/scratchbox/compilers/arm-linux-gcc3.4.cs-glibc2.3/bin/arm-linux-ar
</code></pre>

<p>If you are cross-compiling for a different architecture, or you have
gotten a different version of the Scratchbox toolchains, you will need
to adjust these variables.</p>

<p>A second detail: note that when we compiled hello.cyc, we used the
-nogc flag.  This means that the garbage collector will not be linked
in.  In fact, the normal build process will not cross-compile the
garbage collector at all, so the compile will fail if you do not use
-nogc.</p>

<p>It is possible to cross-compile the garbage collector, but I don&#8217;t
have much experience with it.  If you are using Scratchbox, then you
can compile the garbage collector in the ARM target, and hello.cyc
will run on the 770 with the garbage collector linked in.  It does not
run in the ARM target itself, though.</p>

<p>To cross-compile the garbage collector in the ARM target, do this:</p>

<pre><code>cd gc
./configure --enable-threads=no --enable-shared=no --enable-cplusplus=no
make
mv .libs/libgc.a /usr/local/lib/cyclone/cyc-lib/arm-maemo-elf/gc.a
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should be able to compile programs to use the garbage
collector as usual, by leaving off the -nogc flag.</p>

<h2>Write once run anywhere</h2>

<p>Shocking news: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/15/78287_HNjaveclipsemotorola_1.html">write once run anywhere is a mirage</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; Motorola is seeking development of a broader mobile and software
  ecosystem for Java, with the goal of yielding &#8220;write-once, run
  everywhere&#8221; implementation capabilities.</p>
  
  <p>&#8230; Currently, a handset maker licenses a JSR from another company
  and then makes changes to the reference implementation to make it
  work on their phone. This is done over and over again, resulting in
  platform variations, according to Motorola.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, as <a href="http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=295">Carmack said last year</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write-once-run-anywhere. Ha. Hahahahaha. We are only testing on four
  platforms right now, and not a single pair has the exact same
  quirks. All the commercial games are tweaked and compiled
  individually for each (often 100+) platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s be honest: &#8220;write once run anywhere&#8221; should more
accurately be, &#8220;write once run anywhere that C already runs, taking
care of any portability issues.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a nice goal, but the
portability problem at the core has not gone away.  We still need a
technology to solve the portability problem, securely and reliably,
and Java does not address this at all.</p>

<h2>Nokia 770</h2>

<p>Since the release of Cyclone 1.0 last week, we&#8217;ve heard from a number
of people interested in using Cyclone to program embedded systems.
It&#8217;s actually pretty easy to set up, so I thought I&#8217;d make a couple of
posts to document my experiences in cross-compiling programs for the
Nokia 770 Internet Tablet.  Here&#8217;s the first.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the Nokia 770, it&#8217;s a computer with a
four-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and wifi.  It&#8217;s very handy to keep
around in case you need to browse the web for a moment, to look up a
fact or news story, or just to pass the time.</p>

<p><img src="/files/770-cyclone.jpg" alt="The Nokia 770" /></p>

<p>A surprising number of people think the 770 is a flop; the Washington
Post says <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/15/AR2006041500125.html">&#8220;It Does Very Little, and Not Very Well,&#8221;</a> and CNET puts
it on the list of the <a href="http://news.com.com/2300-1041_3-6056647-9.html">&#8220;Worst tech of 2006 (so far).&#8221;</a> My judgment
is the opposite: I&#8217;ve had a 770 since December and I still use it
every day, quite a contrast with the pile of old Palms and Pocket PCs
gathering dust in my closet.</p>

<p>The 770 has two killer features.  First, the screen is beautiful:
800x480 resolution in 4 diagonal inches, or about 225 dpi.  That&#8217;s
about 4 times sharper than a standard laptop screen, and a width of
800 pixels means that most web sites can be viewed without horizontal
scrolling.  Once you experience browsing on the 770, you won&#8217;t bother
with a smartphone or low-res Palm or Pocket PC again.</p>

<p>Second, Nokia is using an open source development model.  The 770 runs
Linux (a 2.6 kernel), the GUI is based on GTK, the compiler is gcc,
the development environment is scratchbox, and all of the tools and
documentation can be downloaded freely, without registration.  I&#8217;ve
gotten Cyclone compiling for the Nintendo DS and the iPod, but
developing for those platforms isn&#8217;t much fun, because you have to
work so hard to get basics like networking going.  Consequently, Nokia
has attracted many more developers and software ports than these other
platforms, even though they were released months or years ahead of the
770.</p>

<p>In my next post, I&#8217;ll give the details on setting up Cyclone to
compile for the 770.</p>

<h2>Signal handling bug in Sendmail</h2>

<p><a href="http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/216">Here&#8217;s an interesting vulnerability</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sendmail contains a signal race vulnerability when receiving and
  processing mail data from remote clients. Sendmail utilizes a signal
  handler for dealing with timeouts that is not async-safe and
  interruption of certain functions by this signal handler will cause
  static data elements to be left in an inconsistent state. These data
  elements can be used to write data to invalid parts of the stack (or
  heap in some scenarios), thus taking control of the vulnerable
  process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a good reminder that signal handling turns any program into a
multithreaded program.</p>

<h2>Garbage collection for Cocoa</h2>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits.ars/2006/5/6/3868">Ars Technica discusses the possibilities for Apple using garbage
collection for Cocoa, their Objective-C development libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#8217;s been possible to use garbage collection with
Objective-C for a long time, using the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage
collector that we use in Cyclone.  The real question is whether Apple
will use garbage collection to replace reference counting in their own
applications.  Ars Technica points out signs that garbage collection
will at least be officially supported in the next version of the
operating system, 10.5 (Leopard).</p>
<p align=right><i> 7 May 2006 by trevor <a href="/blog/trevor/Garbage%20collection%20for%20Cocoa-20060507223549/">#</a></i></p>
<h2>OLPC</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project has some interesting
constraints.  The plan is to distribute millions of laptops to the
developing world, where power and connectivity will be intermittent.
The laptops themselves will have to be inexpensive, so they will have
limited CPU, RAM, and storage (flash only, no disk drive), much less
than what you typically find on a laptop in the US.</p>

<p>This would be a nice platform for Cyclone: besides being
resource-constrained, OLPC will need robust software, since it will be
difficult to update.  Cyclone&#8217;s safety combined with ability to
control the memory footprint would be a win on both counts.</p>

<p>After considering Java (and rejecting it in part because it is not an
open platform), the project has settled on Python as the basic
development platform.  Python has a reputation for speed, but it would
be interesting to see how it compares to Cyclone in speed and memory
footprint.  On the small benchmarks of <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The Computer Language
Shootout</a>, C (compiled with gcc) seems to be something like 15
times faster and less memory hungry than Python.  Assuming that
Cyclone (without garbage collection) is close to C, there is still a
good case to be made for Cyclone.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s usually a good idea to avoid programming language flames, but
<a href="http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/9003/">this one from last year</a> is a bit amusing.  It defines &#8220;freedom
languages&#8221; (Ruby, Python, Perl, Smalltalk) and &#8220;safety languages&#8221;
(C++, Java, C#, VB, Delphi, Haskell, Nice).  At the end of the piece
the author treats us to this astonishing revelation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All other things being equal, I think I&#8217;ll choose freedom</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, &#8220;freedom&#8221; = boxers, &#8220;safety&#8221; = tighty whities (ok, not
really).</p>

<p>The useful bit of information is that the author includes C++ on his
list of &#8220;safety&#8221; languages.  This points up a bit of a problem for
Cyclone: there&#8217;s no accepted definition of &#8220;safety,&#8221; and, in fact,
people use the word to describe unsafe languages.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a good fix for this; if I recall, Matthias
Felleisen took a stab at a general definition of language safety, but
I don&#8217;t know that it went anywhere, and I&#8217;m not aware of other work on
the topic.  And in the end, the general public will use the word as
they want to, not the way we want them to.</p>

<p>I think that the best we can do is try to give examples of what we
consider safe and unsafe.  We should build a wiki page to collect this
information.  In the meantime, here&#8217;s one (perhaps) surprising
example:</p>

<h3>Q: if a program segfaults, is it safe?</h3>

<p>My answer is, <strong>yes</strong>, that may be safe.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you could magically transform every C
program in the world so that in case of a buffer overflow, the program
would immediately segfault.  This would be great!  It would mean that
instead of being corrupted, programs would halt immediately if they
were attacked.  In other words, the system would have a <em>fail-stop</em>
property.</p>

<p>Fail-stop would mean the difference between a corrupted, &#8220;zombie&#8221;
program under the remote control of some attacker, and a dead program.
Not ideal, but a great improvement.  In fact, fail-stop is a crucial
ingredient of one definition of safety.</p>

<p>The same argument can be applied in other cases.  For example, there
is no safety reason to check for NULL pointers, because a NULL pointer
dereference on modern machines will cause a segfault.  There may be
other reasons (recovery from errors), but it isn&#8217;t a safety issue.</p>

<h2>Language popularity</h2>

<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly posts statistics on the technical book market.  <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/state_of_the_computer_book_mar_3.html">This
installment</a> contains the interesting prediction that C# will
replace Java as the most popular language shortly, and may have done
so already:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft languages (VB and C#) are both showing strong growth, while
  Java is weakening, continuing a years-long trend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;.Net languages&#8221; refers to books that cover both C# and VB in the
  same book. If you give C# credit for all the books in this group, C#
  now just edges out Java as the most popular computer programming
  language. And if current growth trends continue, with Java off 6%
  and C# up 68%, C# will significantly extend its lead next quarter.</p>

<h2>Firefox security holes</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a new version of Firefox out (1.5.0.2), with fixes for 22
security issues, <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/19631/">according to Secunia</a>.  My favorite is this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) An error in the garbage collection in the JavaScript engine can be
     exploited to cause a memory corruption.</p>
  
  <p>   Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently garbage collectors are not perfect!  Who knew.</p>

<p>Among the 22 issues there are a bunch that would clearly be prevented
by a safe language like Cyclone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) A boundary error in the CSS border rendering implementation may be
     exploited to write past the end of an array.</p>
  
  <p>4) An integer overflow in the handling of overly long regular
     expressions in JavaScript may be exploited to execute arbitrary
     JavaScript bytecode.</p>
  
  <p>6) An error in the &#8220;InstallTrigger.install()&#8221; method can be exploited
     to cause a memory corruption.</p>
  
  <p>13) An error in the processing of a certain sequence of HTML tags can
      be exploited to cause a memory corruption.</p>
  
  <p>Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.</p>
  
  <p>15) Some errors in the DHTML implementation can be exploited to cause
      a memory corruption.</p>
  
  <p>Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.</p>
  
  <p>16) An integer overflow error in the processing of the CSS
      letter-spacing property can be exploited to cause a heap-based
      buffer overflow.</p>
  
  <p>Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the others might be safety issues as well, but it takes quite
a bit of digging to figure these things out.</p>
