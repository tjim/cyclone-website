<h2>Write once run anywhere</h2>

<p>Shocking news: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/15/78287_HNjaveclipsemotorola_1.html">write once run anywhere is a mirage</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; Motorola is seeking development of a broader mobile and software
  ecosystem for Java, with the goal of yielding &#8220;write-once, run
  everywhere&#8221; implementation capabilities.</p>
  
  <p>&#8230; Currently, a handset maker licenses a JSR from another company
  and then makes changes to the reference implementation to make it
  work on their phone. This is done over and over again, resulting in
  platform variations, according to Motorola.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, as <a href="http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=295">Carmack said last year</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write-once-run-anywhere. Ha. Hahahahaha. We are only testing on four
  platforms right now, and not a single pair has the exact same
  quirks. All the commercial games are tweaked and compiled
  individually for each (often 100+) platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s be honest: &#8220;write once run anywhere&#8221; should more
accurately be, &#8220;write once run anywhere that C already runs, taking
care of any portability issues.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a nice goal, but the
portability problem at the core has not gone away.  We still need a
technology to solve the portability problem, securely and reliably,
and Java does not address this at all.</p>
