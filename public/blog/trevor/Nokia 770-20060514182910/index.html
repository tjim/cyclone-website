<h2>Nokia 770</h2>

<p>Since the release of Cyclone 1.0 last week, we&#8217;ve heard from a number
of people interested in using Cyclone to program embedded systems.
It&#8217;s actually pretty easy to set up, so I thought I&#8217;d make a couple of
posts to document my experiences in cross-compiling programs for the
Nokia 770 Internet Tablet.  Here&#8217;s the first.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the Nokia 770, it&#8217;s a computer with a
four-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, and wifi.  It&#8217;s very handy to keep
around in case you need to browse the web for a moment, to look up a
fact or news story, or just to pass the time.</p>

<p>A surprising number of people think the 770 is a flop; the Washington
Post says <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/15/AR2006041500125.html">&#8220;It Does Very Little, and Not Very Well,&#8221;</a> and CNET puts
it on the list of the <a href="http://news.com.com/2300-1041_3-6056647-9.html">&#8220;Worst tech of 2006 (so far).&#8221;</a> My judgment
is the opposite: I&#8217;ve had a 770 since December and I still use it
every day, quite a contrast with the pile of old Palms and Pocket PCs
gathering dust in my closet.</p>

<p>The 770 has two killer features.  First, the screen is beautiful:
800x480 resolution in 4 diagonal inches, or about 225 dpi.  That&#8217;s
about 4 times sharper than a standard laptop screen, and a width of
800 pixels means that most web sites can be viewed without horizontal
scrolling.  Once you experience browsing on the 770, you won&#8217;t bother
with a smartphone or low-res Palm or Pocket PC again.</p>

<p>Second, Nokia is using an open source development model.  The 770 runs
Linux (a 2.6 kernel), the GUI is based on GTK, the compiler is gcc,
the development environment is scratchbox, and all of the tools and
documentation can be downloaded freely, without registration.  I&#8217;ve
gotten Cyclone compiling for the Nintendo DS and the iPod, but
developing for those platforms isn&#8217;t much fun, because you have to
work so hard to get basics like networking going.  Consequently, Nokia
has attracted many more developers and software ports than these other
platforms, even though they were released months or years ahead of the
770.</p>

<p>In my next post, I&#8217;ll give the details on setting up Cyclone to
compile for the 770.</p>
