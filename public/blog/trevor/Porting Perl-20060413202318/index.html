<h2>Porting Perl</h2>

<p>Perl is one of the great languages, measured in utility and in influence
on other languages.  Language snobs can argue about the fine details,
but there&#8217;s no denying that most languages going forward will have
facilities for regular expression parsing and extraction, and these
will most probably be compatible with Perl.</p>

<p>Inevitably one wants to port some useful bit of Perl to (<em>insert favorite
language here</em>).  I needed to do this for some of the web site software.
It&#8217;s tedious and error prone work.  One of the main difficulties is
translating Perl regular expressions.  You might have a Perl compatible
regular expression library for your language, but it probably uses
native string literals for the regular expressions, not Perl string literals.</p>

<p>Perl has unusual conventions for writing regular expressions.  For example,
they can be delimited by practically any character:</p>

<pre><code>s/foo/bar/
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>s!foo!bar!
</code></pre>

<p>The point is that if you want to match the character &#8216;/&#8217;, you can use a
different delimiter, and then you don&#8217;t have to escape the &#8216;/&#8217;.</p>

<p>Perl also has a way to ignore whitespace in patterns, the <code>x</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>s/hello
  world//x
</code></pre>

<p>will delete an occurrence of &#8220;helloworld&#8221;.  This is useful for complicated
patterns (you can also use comments in the pattern), but it also means that
if you want to match a newline (<code>\n</code>) in the pattern, you&#8217;ve got to be very
careful in your translation of the pattern to your favorite language.</p>

<p>These issues and a bunch of others convinced me that it would be worth
writing a little tool to help converting Perl to Cyclone.  It&#8217;s very
incomplete (only translates s/// and m// and qr//) but for some Perl
programs (coincidentally, the ones I wanted to translate) it works great.</p>
