<h2>OLPC</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project has some interesting
constraints.  The plan is to distribute millions of laptops to the
developing world, where power and connectivity will be intermittent.
The laptops themselves will have to be inexpensive, so they will have
limited CPU, RAM, and storage (flash only, no disk drive), much less
than what you typically find on a laptop in the US.</p>

<p>This would be a nice platform for Cyclone: besides being
resource-constrained, OLPC will need robust software, since it will be
difficult to update.  Cyclone&#8217;s safety combined with ability to
control the memory footprint would be a win on both counts.</p>

<p>After considering Java (and rejecting it in part because it is not an
open platform), the project has settled on Python as the basic
development platform.  Python has a reputation for speed, but it would
be interesting to see how it compares to Cyclone in speed and memory
footprint.  On the small benchmarks of <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The Computer Language
Shootout</a>, C (compiled with gcc) seems to be something like 15
times faster and less memory hungry than Python.  Assuming that
Cyclone (without garbage collection) is close to C, there is still a
good case to be made for Cyclone.</p>

hardware.</p>
