<h2>Pattern Forms</h2>

<p>This page describes all the forms that patterns can take in Cyclone.
For each pattern form, you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The syntax </li>
<li>The types of expressions it can match against (to avoid a
compile-time error)</li>
<li>The expressions the pattern matches against (other expressions
cause a match failure)</li>
<li>The bindings the pattern introduces, if any. </li>
</ul>

<p>There is one compile-time rule that is the same for all forms: All
variables (and type variables) in a pattern must be distinct. For
example, &#8220;let Pair(fst,fst) = pr;&#8221; is not allowed.</p>

<p>You may want to read the descriptions for variable and struct patterns
first because we have already explained their use informally.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Variable patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: an identifer </li>
<li>Types for match: all types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: all expressions </li>
<li>Bindings introduced: the identifier is bound to the expression
being matched</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Wildcard patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: _ (underscore, note this use is completely independent
of _ for [type inference][13])</li>
<li>Type for match: all types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: all expressions </li>
<li>Bindings introduced: none. Hence it is like a variable pattern
that uses a fresh identifier. Using _ is better style because it
indicates the value matched is not used. Notice that &#8220;let _ =
e;&#8221; is equivalent to e.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>As patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: x as p where x is an identifier and p is a pattern. </li>
<li>Types for match: all types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: all expressions </li>
<li>Bindings introduced: if the expression matches the pattern p,
then its value is bound to x. Thus, a variable pattern is simply
shorthand for &#8220;x as _&#8221;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reference patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: *x (i.e., the * character followed by an identifier) </li>
<li>Types for match: all types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: all expressions. (Very subtle notes:
Currently, reference patterns may only appear inside of other
patterns so that the compiler can determine the region for the
pointer type assigned to x. They also may not occur under a
datatype pattern that has existential types unless there is a
pointer pattern in-between.)</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: x is bound to <em>the address of</em> the
expression being matched. Hence if matched against a value of
type t in region <code>r, the type of x is t@</code>r.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Numeric constant patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: An int, char, or float constant </li>
<li>Types for match: numeric types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: numeric values such that == applied to the
value and the pattern yields true. (Standard C numeric
promotions apply. Note that comparing floating point values for
equality is usually a bad idea.)</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: none </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>NULL<em>*</strong> constant patterns</em>*</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: NULL</li>
<li>Types for match: nullable pointer types, including ? types </li>
<li>Expressions matched: NULL</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: none </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enum patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: an enum constant </li>
<li>Types for match: the enum type containing the constant </li>
<li>Expressions matched: the constant </li>
<li>Bindings introduced: none </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tuple patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syntax: $(p1,&#8230;,pn[,&#8230;]) where p1,&#8230;,pn are patterns. The
trailing comma and ellipses (&#8230;) are optional.</p></li>
<li><p>Types for match: if no ellipses, then tuple types with exactly n
fields, where pi matches the type of the tuple&#8217;s ith field. If
the ellipses are present, then matches a tuple with at least n
fields.</p></li>
<li>Expressions matched: tuples where the ith field matches pi for i
between 1 and n.</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: bindings introduced by p1, &#8230;, pn. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Struct patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syntax: There are three forms: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>X(p1,&#8230;,pn[,&#8230;]) where X is the name of a struct with n
fields and p1,&#8230;,pn are patterns. This syntax is shorthand
for <code>X{.f1 = p1, ..., .fn = pn [,...]}</code> where fi is the ith
field in X.</p></li>
<li><p><code>X{.f1 = p1, ..., .fn = pn [,...]}</code> where the fields of X are
f1, &#8230;, fn but not necessarily in that order</p></li>
<li><p><code>{.f1 = p1, ..., .fn = pn [,...]}</code> which is the same as above
except that struct name X has been omitted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Types for match: struct X (or instantiations when struct X is
polymorphic) such that pi matches the type of fi for i between 1
and n. If the ellipses are not present, then each member of the
struct must have a pattern.</p></li>
<li>Expressions matched: structs where the value in fi matches pi
for i between 1 and n.</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: bindings introduced by p1,&#8230;,pn </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Tagged Union patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syntax: There are two forms: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>X{.fi = p}</code> where the members of X are f1, &#8230;, fn and fi is
one of those members.</p></li>
<li><p><code>{{.f1 = p</code> which is the same as above except that union name
X has been omitted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Types for match: union X (or instantiations when union X is
polymorphic) such that p matches the type of fi.</p></li>
<li>Expressions matched: tagged unions where the last member written
was fi and the value of that member matches p.</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: bindings introduced by p. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pointer patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: &amp;p where p is a pattern </li>
<li>Types for match: pointer types, including ? types. Also datatype
Foo @ (or instantiations of it) when the pattern is
&amp;Bar(p1,&#8230;,pn) and Bar is a variant of datatype Foo and pi
matches the type of the ith value carried by Bar.</li>
<li>Expressions matched: non-null pointers where the value pointed
to matches p. Note this explanation includes the case where the
expression has type datatype Foo @ and the pattern is
&amp;Bar(p1,&#8230;,pn) and the current variant of the expression is
&#8220;pointer to Bar&#8221;.</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: bindings introduced by p </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Datatype patterns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax: X if X is a variant that carries no values. Else
X(p1,&#8230;,pn[,&#8230;]) where X is the name of a variant and p1, &#8230;,
pn are patterns. As with tuple and struct patterns, the ellipses
are optional.</li>
<li>Types for match: datatype Foo (or instantiations of it). </li>
<li>Expressions matched: If X is non-value-carrying, then X. If X is
value-carrying, then values created from the constructor X such
that pi matches the ith field.</li>
<li>Bindings introduced: bindings introduced by p1,&#8230;,pn </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
