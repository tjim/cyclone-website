<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>As in C, one should think of Cyclone pointers as just
addresses. Operations on pointers, such as *x, x->f, and x[e], behave
the same as in C, with the exception that run-time checks sometimes
precede memory accesses. (Exactly when and where these checks occur is
described below.) However, Cyclone prevents memory errors such as
dereferencing dangling pointers or indexing outside an array&#8217;s bounds,
so it may reject some operations on pointers that C would accept.</p>

<p>In order to enforce memory safety and distinguish between different
uses of pointers, Cyclone pointer types include additional qualifiers
when compared to their C counterparts. These qualifiers are described
briefly below and in more detail throughout this section:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>@nullable: Pointers with this qualifier may be NULL. This
qualifier is present by default and overridden by the @notnull
qualifier. A dereference of a @nullable pointer will generally be
preceded by a NULL-check.</p></li>
<li><p>@notnull: Pointers with this qualifier may never be NULL, and thus
never need to be checked for NULL upon dereference. This qualifier
is not present by default and must be put in explicitly. The
qualifier may be abbreviated by using &#8220;@&#8221; in place of the usual
pointer &#8220;*&#8221;. So, for instance, the type &#8220;int *@notnull&#8221; can be
abbreviated by &#8220;int @&#8221;. Currently, the @notnull qualifier cannot
be used on pointers with the @fat qualifier.</p></li>
<li><p>@thin: Pointers with this qualifier have the same representation
as in C (i.e., a single machine word.) However, arithmetic on thin
pointers is not supported except when the pointer is also
qualified as @zeroterm (see below). This qualifier is present by
default and overridden by the @fat qualifier.</p></li>
<li><p>@fat: Pointers with this qualifier consist of a thin pointer plus
additional information needed to support safe pointer arithmetic
and dereferencing. (The current implementation uses three words in
total.) Each dereference of a fat pointer incurs both a NULL-check
and a bounds check to ensure that the pointer points to a valid
object. The @fat qualifier cannot be used with the @notnull or
@numelts qualifiers (though we expect to change this in the
future.) The numelts operation may be applied to fat pointers to
determine the number of elements in the (forward) sequence that
may be safely dereferenced. Finally, the qualifier may be
abbreviated by using &#8220;?&#8221; in place of the usual pointer &#8220;*&#8221;. So,
for instance, the type &#8220;int *@fat&#8221; can be abbreviated by &#8220;int ?&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>@numelts(e): The term e must be a <em>static</em> expression (i.e., a
constant expression or one involving valueof) and indicates an
upper bound on the number of objects that that the pointer refers
to. For example, if p has type T *@numelts(42), then either p is
NULL or else for 0 &lt;= i &lt; e, the expression p[i] is guaranteed to
contain a T object. This qualifier may not be used in conjunction
with @fat. If omitted on a @thin pointer, then @numelts(1) is
inserted by default. This qualifier can be abbreviated by writing
the bounds expression e in curly braces. For instance, the type
&#8220;int *@numelts(42)&#8221; can be abbreviated by &#8220;int *{42}&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>@zeroterm: This qualifier is used for zero-terminated sequences,
such as C-style strings, and provides an alternative to fat
pointers for doing safe pointer arithmetic without knowing bounds
statically. This qualifier can only be used on pointers whose
element type admits zero or NULL as a value, including integral
types, and @nullable pointer types. Arithmetic in the forward
direction is possible with zero-terminated pointers (e.g., p++) as
is a subscript with a positive index (e.g., p[i]). However, the
compiler inserts code to ensure that the index does not step over
the final zero. When updating a zero-terminated array, the
compiler also ensures that the final zero is not overwritten with
a non-zero value. It is generally best to coerce a thin,
zero-terminated pointer to a fat, zero-terminated pointer to avoid
these overheads. This qualifier is only present by default for
char pointers. It can be overridden with the @nozeroterm
qualifier. This qualifier may also be used on array types.</p></li>
<li><p>@nozeroterm: This qualifier is present by default on all pointer
types except for char pointers. It is used to override the
implicit @zeroterm qualfier for char pointers. This qualifier may
also be used on array types.</p></li>
<li><p>@effect(<code>`e</code>): This qualifier is used to indicate the set of regions into
which a pointer may point. The qualifier may
be abbreviated by simply writing the region name after any other
Cyclone qualifiers. For instance, the type &#8220;<code>int *@notnull
@effect(`e)</code>&#8221; may be abbreviated as &#8220;<code>int @`e</code>&#8221;. An effect qualifier can also be of the form &#8220;<code>@effect(`e1+`e2+...+`en)</code>&#8221; which represents a set of regions formed by the union of the regions represented by each &#8220;<code>`ei</code>&#8221;.  The rules about
default region annotations are context-dependent and therefore
described below. A prior form of this qualifier, &#8220;<code>@region(`r)</code>&#8221; is deprecated.</p></li>
<li><p>@aqual(&#8230;): This qualifier is used to specify the aliasability of
the pointer. Valid arguments to the @aqual(&#8230;) qualifier are
ALIASABLE, UNIQUE, REFCNT, RESTRICTED, each of which impose a
different aliasing discipline on the pointer. A type variable of
kind Q may also appear as an argument. See
<a href='/wiki/Pointers with Restricted Aliasing'>Pointers with Restricted Aliasing</a> for more details.</p>
