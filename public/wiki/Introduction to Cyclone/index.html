<h2>Introduction to Cyclone</h2>

<p>Cyclone is a language for C programmers who want to write secure,
robust programs. It&#8217;s a dialect of C designed to be <em>safe</em>: free of
crashes, buffer overflows, format string attacks, and so on. Careful C
programmers can produce safe C programs, but, in practice, many C
programs are unsafe. Our goal is to make <em>all</em> Cyclone programs safe,
regardless of how carefully they were written. All Cyclone programs
must pass a combination of compile-time, link-time, and run-time
checks designed to ensure safety.</p>

<p>There are other safe programming languages, including Java, ML, and
Scheme. Cyclone is novel because its syntax, types, and semantics are
based closely on C. This makes it easier to interface Cyclone with
legacy C code, or port C programs to Cyclone. And writing a new
program in Cyclone &#8220;feels&#8221; like programming in C: Cyclone tries to
give programmers the same control over data representations, memory
management, and performance that C has.</p>

<p>Cyclone&#8217;s combination of performance, control, and safety make it a
good language for writing systems and security software. Writing such
software in Cyclone will, in turn, motivate new research into safe,
low-level languages. For instance, originally, all heap-allocated data
in Cyclone were reclaimed via a conservative garbage collector. Though
the garbage collector ensures safety by preventing programs from
accessing deallocated objects, it also kept Cyclone from being used in
latency-critical or space-sensitive applications such as network
protocols or device drivers. To address this shortcoming, we have
added a region-based memory management system based on the work of
Tofte and Talpin. The region-based memory manager allows you some
real-time control over memory management and can significantly reduce
space overheads when compared to a conventional garbage
collector. Furthermore, the region type system ensures the same safety
properties as a collector: objects cannot be accessed outside of their
lifetimes.</p>

<p>This manual is meant to provide an informal introduction to
Cyclone. We have tried to write the manual from the perspective of a C
programmer who wishes either to port code from C to Cyclone, or
develop a new system using Cyclone. Therefore, we assume a fairly
complete understanding of C.</p>

<p>Obviously, Cyclone is a work in progress and we expect to make
substantial changes to the design and implementation. Your feedback
(and patience) is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The people involved in the development of Cyclone are now at Harvard,
AT&amp;T, Maryland, and Washington; much work began at Cornell. Dan
Grossman, Trevor Jim, and Greg Morrisett worked out the initial design
and implementation, basing the language to some degree on Popcorn, a
safe-C-like language that was developed at Cornell as part of the
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc">Typed Assembly Language</a> (TAL) project. Mike Hicks ported a
number of libraries and programs to Cyclone, helped with the
configuration and installation procedures, and has been the lead on
adding unique and reference-counted pointers to Cyclone, among other
things. Mathieu Baudet contributed the bulk of the code for the
link-checker. Matthew Harris did much of the hard work needed to wrap
and import the necessary libraries. Yanling Wang ported bison and flex
to Cyclone. James Cheney has added support for representation types,
singleton ints, marshalling support, etc. Nikhil Swamy added support
for reaps and the cyclone-inf mode. All of these people have also
contributed by finding and fixing various bugs. A number of other
people have also helped to find bugs and/or contributed key design
ideas including Mujtaba Ali, Fred Smith, Nathan Lutchansky, Rajit
Manohar, Bart Samwell, Emmanuel Schanzer, Frances Spalding, Jeff
Vinocur, and David Walker.</p>
