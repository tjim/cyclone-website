<h2>Why Cyclone</h2>

<h2>C is not going away</h2>
<p>
Although newer languages (Java, C#, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, &#8230;) are
eclipsing C in usage and vitality, C is not going away.  In fact, C programs
will comprise the core of our computing environment for the foreseeable
future.  95% of the code running on your desktop today (2006) is written
in C, or its relative, C++ (e.g., the OS, your mail client and web browser).</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons for this, but they all boil down to this:
<strong>C gives programmers control over resources</strong>.  The programmer
controls memory layout, which affects performance (an array of structs
in C is contiguous in memory, but an array of objects in Java may not
be contiguous).  The programmer controls when memory gets allocated
and deallocated, and can reuse already allocated memory.  And so on.</p>

<p>C programs can therefore be extremely efficient (at the price of programming effort).
In contrast, the newer languages all offer programmer convenience at the
expense of control.  Put another way, from a bird&#8217;s eye view, all of the new languages are
about the same, while C is an entirely different creature.</p>

<p>Core infrastructure that is already written in C or that requires maximal
efficiency (the OS) will continue to rely on C for some time.</p>

<h2>C is unsafe</h2>

<p>The problem with this is that it is very easy to write C code that is
vulnerable to attack.  Conversely, it is very hard to write C code that
is <em>not</em> vulnerable to buffer overflows and similar bugs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the programs that are written in C are those most in need of
hardening: the operating system and network servers.</p>

<h2>Therefore, Cyclone</h2>

<p>Cyclone thus tries to fill an empty niche: the safe language with C&#8217;s level
of control and efficiency.</p>
