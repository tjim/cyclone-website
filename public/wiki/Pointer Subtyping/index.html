<h2>Pointer Subtyping</h2>

<p>Some pointer types may be safely used in contexts where another
pointer type is expected. In particular, T *@notnull is a subtype of
T *@nullable which means that a not-null pointer can be passed anywhere
a possibly-null pointer is expected.</p>

<p>Similarly, a T *@numelts(42) pointer can be passed anywhere a
T *@numelts(30) pointer is expected, because the former describes
sequences that have at least 42 elements, which satisifes the
constraint that it has at least 30 elements.</p>

<p>In addition, <code>T*@effect(`r)</code> is a subtype of <code>T*@effect(`r+`s)</code>
For example the following code is type-correct:</p>

<pre><code>  void foo(int x) {
    int *@effect(`foo+`H) y = &amp;x;
    y = new 1;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The first assignment is correct since &amp;x is of type <code>int *@effect(`foo)</code> and the type of y states that y is a pointer into the region <code>`foo</code> or into the heap. The second assignment is correct since &#8220;new 1&#8221; is a heap pointer and y is permitted to point into the heap. </p>

<p>It is possible to specify constraints on effect variables that appear in the parameters of a function as part of the function&#8217;s type. For instance, the type of the following function states that the set of regions represented by <code>`r</code> is a subset of the set of regions represented by <code>`s</code>. </p>

<pre><code>  void foobar(int *`r a, int *`s b : `r &lt; `s) {
         b = a;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>In general, constraints among the effect variables that appear in a function&#8217;s parameters are specified after the arguments in a comma-separated list of constraints separated from that arguments by a colon &#8220;:&#8221;. In the body of the function foobar above, the assignment is legal since <code>`r</code> is guaranteed to be a subset of <code>`s</code>.  (We support another form of constraint &#8220;<code>single(`e)</code>&#8221; which states that the set of regions represented by <code>`e</code> must be a singleton. This is described further in the section &#8220;Pointers with Restricted Aliasing&#8221;.)</p>

<p>Finally, when T is a subtype of S, then <code>T*</code> is a subtype of <code>const
S*</code>. So, for instance, if we declare:</p>

<pre><code>// nullable int pointers
typedef int * nintptr_t;
// not-nullable int pointers
typedef int *@notnull intptr_t;
</code></pre>

<p>then <code>intptr_t *</code> is a subtype of <code>const nintptr_t *</code>. Note, however,
that &#8220;const&#8221; is important to get this kind of deep subtyping.</p>

<p>The following example shows what could go wrong if we allowed deep
subtyping without the const:</p>

<pre><code>  void f(int *@notnull *@notnull x) {
    int *@nullable *@notnull y = x; 
    // would be legal if int *@nullable *@notnull 
    // was a subtype of int *@notnull *@notnull.
    *y = NULL;    
    // legal because *y has type int *@nullable
    **x;          
    // seg faults even though the type of *x is 
    // int *@notnull
  }
</code></pre>
