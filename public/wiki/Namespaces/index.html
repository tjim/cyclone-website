<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<pre><code>  namespace Foo { 
    int x = 0; 
    int f() { return x; }  
  }
</code></pre>

<p>As in C++, namespaces are used to avoid name clashes in code. For example:
declares an integer named Foo::x and a function named Foo::f. Note
that within the namespace, you don&#8217;t need to use the qualified
name. For instance, Foo::f refers to Foo::x as simply x. We could also
simply write &#8220;namespace Foo;&#8221; (note the trailing semi-colon) and leave
out the enclosing braces. Every declaration (variables, functions,
types, typedefs) following this namespace declaration would be placed
in the Foo namespace.</p>

<p>As noted before, you can refer to elements of a namespace using the
&#8220;::&#8221; notation. Alternatively, you can open up a namespace with a
&#8220;using&#8221; declaration. For example, we could follow the above code with:</p>

<pre><code>  namespace Bar {  
    using Foo { 
      int g() { return f(); } 
    } 
    int h() { return Foo::f(); } 
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we opened the Foo namespace within the definition of Bar::g. One
can also write &#8220;using Foo;&#8221; to open a namespace for the remaining
definitions in the current block.</p>

<p>Namespaces can nest as in C++.   </p>

<p>Currently, namespaces are only supported at the top-level and you
can&#8217;t declare a qualified variable directly. Rather, you have to write
a namespace declaration to encapsulate it. For example, you cannot
write &#8220;int Foo::x = 3;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following subtle issues and <strong>implementation bugs</strong> may leave you
scratching your head:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The current implementation translates qualified Cyclone variables
to C identifiers very naively: each :: is translated to _
(underscore). This translation is wrong because it can introduce
clashes that are not clashes in Cyclone, such as in the following:</p>

<pre><code>namespace Foo { int x = 7; }
int Foo_x = 9;
</code></pre>

<p>So avoid prefixing your identifiers with namespaces in your
program. We intend to fix this bug in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Because #include is defined as textual substitution, the following
are usually very bad ideas: Having &#8220;namespace Foo;&#8221; or &#8220;using
Foo;&#8221; at the top level of a header file. After all, you will be
changing the identifiers produced or the identifiers available in
every file that includes the header file. Having #include
directives within the scope of namespace declarations. After all,
you are changing the names of the identifiers in the header file
by (further) qualifying them. Unfortunately, the current system
uses the C pre-processor before looking at the code, so it cannot
warn you of these probable errors.</p>

<p>In short, you are advised to not use the &#8220;semicolon syntax&#8221; in header
files and you are advised to put all #include directives at the top of
files, before any namespace or using declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>The translation of identifiers declared extern &#8220;C&#8221; is
different. Given</p>

<pre><code>namespace Foo { extern "C" int x; }
</code></pre>

<p>the Cyclone code refers to the global variable as Foo::x, but the
translation to C will convert all uses to just x. The following code
will therefore get compiled incorrectly (f will return 4):</p>

<pre><code>namespace Foo { extern "C" int x; }
int f() {
  int x = 2;
  return x + Foo::x;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
