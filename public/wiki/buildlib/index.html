<h2>buildlib</h2>

<p>buildlib is a tool that semi-automatically constructs a Cyclone
interface to C code. It scans C header files and builds Cyclone header
files and stub code so that Cyclone programs can call the C code. We
use it to build the Cyclone interface to the C standard library (in
much the same way that gcc uses the fixincludes program).</p>

<p>To use buildlib, you must construct a <em>spec file</em> that tells it what C
headers to scan, and what functions and constants to extract from the
headers. By convention, the names of spec files end in .cys. If
spec.cys is a spec file, then buildlib is invoked by</p>

<pre><code>  buildlib spec.cys
</code></pre>

<p>The output of buildlib is placed in a directory, BUILDLIB.OUT. The
output consists of Cyclone header files and the stub files cstubs.c
and cycstubs.cyc.</p>

<h4>Spec files</h4>

<p>The form of a spec file is given by the following grammar. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>spec-file</em>:     (empty) <br />
  | <em>spec</em> <em>spec-file</em></p>
  
  <p><em>spec</em>:     <em>header-name</em> : <em>directives</em> ;</p>
  
  <p><em>directives</em>:     (empty) <br />
  | <em>directive</em> <em>directives</em></p>
  
  <p><em>directive</em>:     cpp { <em>balanced-braces</em> } <br />
  | include { <em>ids</em> } <br />
  | hstub [<em>id</em>] { <em>balanced-braces</em> } <br />
  | cycstub [<em>id</em>] { <em>balanced-braces</em> } <br />
  | cstub [<em>id</em>] { <em>balanced-braces</em> }</p>
  
  <p><em>ids</em>:     (empty) <br />
  | <em>id</em> <em>balanced-braces</em>* <em>ids</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The non-terminal <em>id</em> refers to C identifiers, and <em>header-name</em>
ranges over C header names (e.g., stdio.h, sys/types.h). We use
<em>balanced-braces</em> to refer to any sequence of C tokens with balanced
braces, ignoring braces inside of comments, strings, and character
constants.</p>

<h4>Directives</h4>

<p><strong>include</strong> The include directive is used to extract constants and
  type definitions from C header files and put them into the
  equivalent Cyclone header file. For example, here is part of the
  spec that we use to interface to C&#8217;s errno.h:</p>

<pre><code>  errno.h:
  include { E2BIG EACCES EADDRINUSE ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The spec says that the Cyclone version of errno.h should use the C
definitions of error constants like E2BIG. These are typically
macro-defined as integers, but the integers can differ from system to
system. We ensure that Cyclone uses the right constants by running
buildlib on each system.</p>

<p>For another example, our spec for sys/types.h reads, in part: </p>

<pre><code>  sys/types.h:
  include { id_t mode_t off_t pid_t ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Here the symbols are typedef names, and the result will be that the
Cyclone header file contains the typedefs that define id_t,
etc. Again, these can differ from system to system.</p>

<p>You can use include to obtain not just constants (macros) and
typedefs, but struct and union definitions as well. Furthermore, if a
definition you include requires any other definitions that you do not
explicitly include, those other definitions will be placed into the
Cyclone header too. Moreover, for all such definitions, you can
include an optional, expected Cyclonedefinition that is &#8220;equivalent&#8221;
to the C definition on your system. By &#8220;equivalent,&#8221; we mean that your
definition defines all of the same elements as the system definition
(but possibly fewer), and each of these elements is
&#8220;representation-compatible&#8221; in the sense that they use the same amount
of storage when compiled. As example, here is our spec for grp.h:</p>

<pre><code>include {
  gid_t
  group {
    struct group {
      char @gr_name;
      char @gr_passwd;
      gid_t gr_gid;
      char ** @zeroterm gr_mem;
    };  
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This provides richer information than the compatible definition on
most systems. Here is the Linux definition:</p>

<pre><code>struct group {
  char *gr_name;
  char *gr_passwd;
  gid_t gr_gid;
  char **gr_mem;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The user definition refines the system definition by indicating that
for group strings gr<em>name and gr</em>passwd must be non-NULL, and
indicates that the array of strings gr_mem, is null-terminated. But
note that the two definitions are representation-compatible in that
they have the same run-time storage requirements. The Cyclone version
provides more precise type information. You can provide user
definitions for enumerated types and typedef&#8217;s as well.</p>

<p>Some refinements (such as polymorphism), are not yet supported for
user definitions. Also, include does not work for variable or function
declarations. You have to use the hstub directive to add variable and
function declarations to your Cyclone header.</p>

<p><strong>cstub</strong> The cstub directive adds code (the [<em>balanced-braces</em>][12])
  to the C stub file. If an optional [<em>id</em>][14] is used, then the code
  will be added to the stub file only if the [<em>id</em>][14] is declared by
  the C header. This is useful because every system defines a
  different subset of the C standard library.</p>

<p><strong>cycstub</strong> The cycstub directive is like the cstub directive, except
  that the code is added to the Cyclone stub file.</p>

<p><strong>hstub</strong> The hstub directive is like the cstub directive, except that
  the code is added to the Cyclone header file.</p>

<p><strong>cpp</strong> The cpp directive is used to tell buildlib to scan some extra
  header files before scanning the header file of the spec. This is
  useful when a header file can&#8217;t be parsed in isolation. For example,
  the standard C header sys/resource.h is supposed to define struct
  timeval, but on some systems, this is defined in sys/types.h, which
  must be included before sys/resource.h for that file to parse. This
  can be handled with a spec like the following:</p>

<pre><code>  sys/resource.h:
  cpp {
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
  }
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause sys/types.h to be scanned by buildlib before
sys/resource.h.</p>

<p>You can also use the cpp directive to directly specify anything that
might appear in a C include file (e.g., macros).</p>

<h4>Options</h4>

<p>buildlib has the following options. </p>

<p><strong>-d <em>directory</em></strong> Use <em>directory</em> as the output directory instead of
   the default BUILDLIB.OUT.</p>

<p><strong>-gather and -finish</strong> buildlib works in two phases. In the gather
   phase, buildlib grabs the C headers listed in the spec file from
   their normal locations in the C include tree, and stores them in a
   special format in the output directory. In the finish phase,
   buildlib uses the specially formatted C headers to build the
   Cyclone headers and stub files. The -gather flag tells buildlib to
   perform just the gather phase, and the -finish flag tells it to
   perform just the finish phase.</p>

<p>buildlib&#8217;s two-phase strategy is intended to support cross
compilation. A Cyclone compiler on one architecture can compile to a
second architecture provided it has the other architecture&#8217;s Cyclone
header files. These headers can be generated on the first architecture
from the output of the gather phase on the second architecture. This
is more general than just having the second architecture&#8217;s Cyclone
headers, because it permits works even in the face of some changes in
the spec file or buildlib itself (which would change the other
architecture&#8217;s Cyclone headers).</p>

<p><strong>-gatherscript</strong> The -gatherscript flag tells buildlib to output a
   shell script that, when executed, performs buildlib&#8217;s gather
   phase. This is useful when porting Cyclone to an unsupported
   architecture, where buildlib itself does not yet work. The script
   can be executed on the unsupported architecture, and the result can
   be moved to a supported architecture, which can then cross-compile
   itself to the new architecture.</p>
